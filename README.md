# Stonks ðŸ“Š

Stonks is a **crypto market dashboard** built with React, React-router, and TypeScript.  
It consumes data from the CoinGecko API to display market information, price charts, and top gainers in a dashboard interface.

## About the Project

This project was created as my first **React frontend project**.  
The main goal was to get comfortable building with React, so that in the future I can extend this project further or create something more complex. For example, integrating my own restAPI or additional features on top of the current dashboard.

## Tech Stack

- **Core:** React (with TypeScript) Â· React Router Â· Tailwind CSS  
- **API:** CoinGecko  
- **UI Components:** Aceternity UI Â· shadcn/ui

## AI Assistance

I used AI for roughly **10%** of this project.  
My primary goal was to **learn React, TypeScript, and frontend development**, so the majority of the work (architecture, data flow, components, integrations) was done by me.  

AI was mainly used as:
- A **Q&A assistant** to understand concepts I was stuck on  
- A way to explore **best practices** and better approaches  
- Help with **small refactors or debugging issues**  
- Most of this README.md file

All key logic, design decisions, and implementations were led by me â€” AI was used as a **learning companion**, not as a replacement for development.
